=====================
= Authors / History =
=====================

This theme came together because of the contributions of many people. You may
find them in #ubuntu-drupal on irc.freenode.net. It was initially started by
David Giard (swe3tdate) and later picked up by Michael Lustfield (MTecknology).
It has since had many patches and contributions from many individuals. At its
beginning, it was disliked by Canonical because it offered an exact clone of
the Ubuntu website. Unknown to the authors, this also violated trademarks.
Following the success of the project, Canonical began driving a community based
theme that differed from the primary website but offered an unmistakable look
and feel for community based projects. Because of the trademark policies, this
theme does not adhere to the base theme provided but instead looks to only
provide an easy means to include the base for community driven projects.

===================
= Drop Down Menus =
===================

To enable drop down menus, simpley enable the nice_menus module. The theme will
check for its existance and use it. It also checks for the deprecated version
of the theme function if the newer version isn't available.

Currently the theme will not work flawlessly with nice_menus. The 'last' class
is not being applied which prevents the right sidebar from showing. This issue
has been addressed in the development version of the module. When version 2 of
the nice_menus module is released this issue will be resolved and compatibility
will be removed. Until then, you can use the development version of the module
and these issues will not apply to you.

==========
= Styles =
==========

The ability to easily modify the look of the theme exists. To do this:
Navigate to: /admin/build/themes/settings/udtheme
Choose the Color Set you wish to use
Click "Save Configuration"

=====================
= GPL Compatibility =
=====================

Out of the box, this theme is to be 100% GPLv2 and GPLv3 compatible. This also
means that no trademark policies may be violated. This is a particular concern
for anyone using an Ubuntu driven theme. As stated in the above section, the
pieces of the theme that violate trademark policy have been "popped" off to
avoid conflicts with both GPL licenses and trademark policies.

===============================
= Including Restricted Pieces =
===============================

If you are building a website for an Ubuntu related project, then it is
acceptable to include the parts that were popped off to maintain compatibility
with other sections. This is only acceptable if your project is directly related
to Ubuntu or one of its dirivatives.

<note type="side">
  The general rule of thumb is:
  If you're directly affiliated with Ubuntu, you can mimic the site very closely
    This theme will not do that
  If you're site is related to the community, you can use the community styles
    This theme enables this ability
  If you're neither of the above, you need to maintain distinction
    This theme does so by default
</note>

To include these popped off sections:
Navigate to: /admin/build/themes/settings/udtheme
Choose the Color Set "Official Ubuntu - see http://bit.ly/Hk4DA"
Find "Theme-specific settings" -> "Ubuntu Affiliated"
Select "Yes"
Click "Save Configuration"

Congratulations - your theme should now mimic the official Ubuntu light-base-theme.

If you are not sure if you qualify for using these tweaks, please visit

Thank you for downloading the Ubuntu-Drupal theme.
We've modified it to match the new Ubuntu branding introduced in 2010.

Here are a few configuration options that are unique to this theme, or recommended.

===================
= Launchpad Login =
===================

Launchpad login is a convenient way for uses to log in using their existing Launchpad accounts:
https://launchpad.net/drupal-launchpad
https://code.launchpad.net/~canonical-isd-hackers/drupal-launchpad/6.x-trunk

Once installed, this this theme has a special appearance for it when used in the
subheader region, so go to admin > blocks and move "Launchpad Login Button" in
the "Second Header" region.

==========
= Search =
==========

If you choose to have search functionality on your site, it is highly reccomended
that you enable it by going to admin > themes > configure > ubuntu drupal theme
then checkmarking the "Search box" in "Toggle display".

Simply moving the search block to a region will not make this block nicely themed.

This way the search box is specially themed in the header.
