Launchpad teams extension module for Drupal 5.x

This module allows you to request team membership data from a participating
OpenID server and assign drupal roles based on the response.  Initially,
launchpad.net is the only known implementing provider. Users can use launchpad
as their OpenID server by using 'https://login.launchpad.net/' as their OpenID.
To accompany this teams module, we have released a module which provides closer
integration with launchpad as an OpenID/single sign-on provider.

[IMPORTANT] Assigning roles from teams

When selecting roles to be assigned based on team membership at login, it is
recommended that you create roles specifically for this purpose.  This is
because the module assigns these roles automatically on login and then unassigns
them on logout, regardless of how they were originally assigned to the user.
